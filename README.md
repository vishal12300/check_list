# Registration

Duplicate registration

Overwrite existing user (existing user takeover)

Username uniqueness

​Insufficient email verification process (also my%00email@mail.com for account tko)

Weak registration implementation or allows disposable email addresses

Fuzz after user creation to check if any folder have been overwritten or created with your profile name

Add only spaces in password

Long password (>200) leads to DoS

Corrupt authentication and session defects: Sign up, don't verify, request change password, change, check if account is active.

Try to re-register repeating same request with same password and different password too

If JSON request, add comma {“email”:“victim@mail.com”,”hacker@mail.com”,“token”:”xxxxxxxxxx”}

Lack of confirmation -> try to register with company email.

Check OAuth with social media registration

Check state parameter on social media registration

Try to capture integration url leading integration takeover

Try login with common credentials​

-----------------

Bypass AntiCSRF tokens

Weak generated security questions

Path traversal on cookies

Reuse cookie after session closed

Logout and click browser "go back" function (Alt + Left arrow)

2 instances open, 1st change or reset password, refresh 2nd instance

With privileged user perform privileged actions, try to repeat with unprivileged user cookie.

-----------

# Profile/Account details

Host header injection for token leakage

Add X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com to receive the reset link with evil.com

Email crafting like victim@gmail.com@target.com

IDOR in reset link

Capture reset token and use with other email/userID

No TLD in email parameter

User carbon copy email=victim@mail.com%0a%0dcc:hacker@mail.com

Access custom pages like /whatever_fake.php (.aspx,.html,.etc)

Add multiple parameters in GET and POST request using different values

Add "[]", "]]", and "[[" in cookie values and parameter values to create errors

Generate error by giving input as "/~randomthing/%s" at the end of URL

Use Burp Intruder "Fuzzing Full" List in input to generate error codes

Try different HTTP Verbs like PATCH, DEBUG or wrong like FAKE
